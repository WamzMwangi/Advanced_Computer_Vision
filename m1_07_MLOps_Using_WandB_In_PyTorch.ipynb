It is commonly used by researchers and developers to monitor and manage their machine learning models and experiments.\n","\n","<a href=\"https://wandb.ai/site\" target=\"_blank\">Wandb</a> offers a range of features and functionalities that aid in the experimentation and iteration process. Here are some key aspects of Wandb:\n","\n","1. **Experiment tracking:** Wandb allows users to log and track various metrics, such as loss, accuracy, and custom metrics, during the training process. These metrics are visualized in real-time on a web-based dashboard, making it easy to monitor model performance and compare different runs.\n","\n","2. **Visualization and analysis:** The platform offers interactive visualizations to analyze training progress, compare experiments, and gain insights from the collected data. It provides tools for visualizing model architectures, learning curves, hyperparameter sweeps, and more.\n","\n","3. **Collaboration and sharing:** Wandb enables collaboration among team members by allowing them to share experiments, results, and insights. It supports collaboration features such as project organization, experiment commenting, and sharing visualizations with colleagues.\n","\n","4. **Reproducibility and versioning:** It facilitates reproducibility of experiments by automatically tracking code versions, system configurations, and dependencies. This helps ensure that experiments can be accurately replicated and compared over time.\n","\n","5. **Integration with popular frameworks:** Wandb seamlessly integrates with popular machine learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras. It provides easy-to-use APIs and libraries for instrumenting experiments and logging metrics.\n","\n","6. **Hyperparameter optimization:** Wandb includes functionality for hyperparameter optimization. Users can perform automated sweeps over different hyperparameter configurations and track the performance of models across various settings.\n","\n","\n","Overall, Wandb serves as a comprehensive platform for experiment management, tracking, visualization, and collaboration, making it easier for machine learning practitioners to organize and analyze their work.\n","\n","The <a href=\"https://docs.wandb.ai/guides\" target=\"_blank\">documentation of WandB</a> is quite extensive and provides detailed coverage of all the different functionalities."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"gLRQFBRqrMfH","metadata":{"id":"gLRQFBRqrMfH"},"source":["Uncomment and run the following code cell to install the required libraries."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"1bYGQqcUpXov","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2023-06-07T07:53:46.254069Z","start_time":"2023-06-07T07:53:46.245071Z"},"id":"1bYGQqcUpXov"},"outputs":[],"source":["# !pip install -qqqU wandb torchinfo tqdm"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"ajOnVHItpXqi","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2023-06-07T07:53:51.069872Z","start_time":"2023-06-07T07:53:47.581648Z"},"id":"ajOnVHItpXqi"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import necesary support libraries.\n","import os\n","import math\n","import random\n","import warnings\n","from urllib.request import urlretrieve\n","from IPython.display import clear_output\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import seaborn as sns\n","from tqdm import trange\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","# Necessary PyTorch imports.\n","import torch\n","import torch.nn as nn\n","from torch import optim\n","import torch.nn.functional as F\n","\n","from torchinfo import summary\n","\n","warnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore', category=UserWarning)\n","\n","# Text formatting\n","BOLD = \"\\033[1m\"\n","END = \"\\033[0m\""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"8987917e","metadata":{"id":"8987917e"},"source":["We define the usual function for deteministic training."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"MYjg3Y_TpXsB","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2023-06-07T07:53:54.917798Z","start_time":"2023-06-07T07:53:54.900227Z"},"id":"MYjg3Y_TpXsB"},"outputs":[],"source":["def seed_everything(seed_value):\n","    np.random.seed(seed_value)\n","    torch.manual_seed(seed_value)\n","    torch.cuda.manual_seed_all(seed_value)\n","    torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True\n","    torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark = False"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"hqjOixbLpvTr","metadata":{"id":"hqjOixbLpvTr"},"source":["## 1 Quick Hands-On tutorial"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6xTMEUp6pvQT","metadata":{"id":"6xTMEUp6pvQT"},"source":["WandB is quite easy and straightforward to use.\n","\n","In essence, there are only 4 small steps we need to do to use WandB.\n","\n","\n","1.

WandB provides an efficient and user-friendly interface for experiment tracking and collaboration in machine learning projects, making it a must-have in any deep learning engineer's toolkit.\n","\n","We then dove into how WandB can be utilized for experiment tracking. We saw how it provides an organized and visually appealing platform to log and visualize experiments, and results. This leads to better transparency, understanding, and debugging capabilities throughout the course of our machine learning project lifecycle.\n","\n","Further, we discovered how WandB Artifacts help in versioning control and tracking. We learned the process of creating versions of datasets and models using Artifacts, providing a systematic approach to handle, track, and manage different versions of our data and models. This functionality helps prevent any confusion or errors that could stem from working with multiple or outdated versions.\n","\n","Lastly, we applied Artifacts in a practical project scenario, highlighting how they can be used. The use of Artifacts further reinforced the collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency that WandB promotes in machine learning workflows.\n","\n","In conclusion, WandB is a powerful tool for managing machine learning projects. Its capabilities such as experiment tracking and versioning through Artifacts significantly enhance the efficiency and productivity of machine learning tasks. By incorporating WandB into our workflow, we can more effectively develop, track, and maintain high-quality machine learning models, fostering a seamless transition from development to deployment.\n","\n","Happy coding and experimenting!"],"metadata":{"id":"mgrmHkiSzOm0"},"id":"mgrmHkiSzOm0"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## References\n","\n","You can learn more about the
